Please go through the documentaion of Morning star to see the commands. I have not seen thoroughly yet. I will do it today.

Dependancies:

1. matplotlib
2. morningstar to pull data
3. datetime as dt
4. FAANG: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google stocks dat
5. pandas_datareader.data as web   #to read data from web
6. json
7 style.use('ggplot')
8. Type of plots/graphs: Our choice.

Ticker symbol for th stocks above: FB, AMZN, APPL, NFLX, GOOGL

Problem: Solution/Represntaion in the form of:

  #1 What’s the change in stock’s price over time? : DataFrame and Graph( Month Vs stock Price) 
  #2 What is the change in volume in the year 2017: Graph
  Note: We shopuld do this 2-D color coded graph for each stock. So, toal 5 graphs for this part
  # What was the daily return average of a stock?: 
      Fot yhoofinance the command for this is: `df.pct_change()`. Don't know for morningstar. Will have ot see the documentation.
  #3 What was the moving average(MA)of various stocks?
      Need to create one col for MA for 10, 20, 50 days.
      AAPL[column_name] = AAPL['Adj Close'].rolling(window=ma,center=False).mean() # We will use soemthing like this. Don't know for MS(Mrning Star)
      Plots/subplosts for this.
  #4 What was the daily return average of a stock?    
        AAPL['Daily Return'] = AAPL['Adj Close'].pct_change() # from Yahoofinance. check morningstar
        sns.distplot(AAPL['Daily Return'].dropna(),bins=100,color='red')
        AAPL['Daily Return'].plot(figsize=(14,5),legend=True,linestyle='--',marker='o')
  
  #5 What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?
     #Reading just the 'Adj Close' column 
     close_df = DataReader(tech_list,'yahoo',start,end)['Adj Close']
     create df with date as index and stock-names as cols
     Graphs:
     check out: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.set_style.html
     We should try the following graphs:
     sns.pairplot(rets_df.dropna())
     sns.jointplot('GOOG','AAPL',rets_df,kind='scatter') # seaborn libraries
     sns.corrplot(rets_df.dropna(),annot=True)
  
  # 6 How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
      We will figure it out latter.
